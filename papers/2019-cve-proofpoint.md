# CVE-2019-20634 (2019) Proofpoint Email Protection

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20634

## tl;dr

Spam classifier was leaking outputs via email metadata, meaning attackers could do something analogous to a chosen plaintext attack to generate a dataset and reconstruct the filtering functionality. They could then use the reconstruction to find spam inputs that would evade the filter.

## Relevance to PPML

If you consider the model itself to be private information then this attack shows how an attacker can reconstruct your model if you leak too much information about its outputs.

## Potential demo

Implement a spam classifier, simulate the chosen input attack with leaky outputs, reconstruct the model and use it to find a spam input that gets evades the filter.
